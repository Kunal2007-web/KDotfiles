This is a project aimed at making the tedious post installation process of configuring your commands and programs from dotfiles easier and faster. It uses bash as the main scripting language. It contains dotfiles for many famous and useful programs people generally use such as:

* ZSH and Additional Scripts
* Git
* Vim
* GPG
* NPM
* LSD: An alternative to the `ls` command.
* Bat: An alternative to the `cat` command.
* Lazygit: A terminal git UI.
* Ngrok: A localhost tunneling software.
* Amfora: A terminal gemini browser.
* Starship: A pretty and highly configurable terminal prompt.
* Topgrade: An program to upgrade all your programs.

more dotfiles will be added with time (and as I start to use them).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

These programs should be installed before using the script:

1. `git`
2. `zsh`
3. `curl`
4. `rsync`
5. `oh my zsh`

This project only works for Unix-like and Unix-based systems, Ex - Linux, MacOS, etc.
