### Suggesting Features

#### Before Suggesting Features

Check if that feature suggestion is already present in the project, or if a feature like yours has been suggested before and if it's being worked on or it has been rejected through [issues](https://github.com/Kunal2007-web/KDotfiles/issues).

#### Submitting a Feature Request

To submit a feature request,

1. Open up a feature request template from [Issues](https://github.com/Kunal2007-web/KDotfiles/issues).

2. Give a suitable title for the feature and provide some details on how you think it would work.

### Doing a Code Contribution

To contribute code to the project:

1. Fork the repository.

2. Before starting work on a new feature or bug fix, we encourage you to open an [issue](https://github.com/Kunal2007-web/KDotfiles/issues) to discuss your proposal or bug report. Mention it in the issue that you will be working on it yourself.

3. After forking the repository, create a new branch for your changes. If you are adding a new feature, include a descriptive name for the branch that reflects the nature of the feature. For example, if you're working on a logging feature, you could name the branch "feature-logging". If you are working on a specific issue or feature request, it's helpful to indicate its ID in the branch name. For instance, if you're addressing issue #12345 regarding a zsh extension fix, you could name the branch "issue-zsh-extension-fix-12345", here, 12345 being the issue ID #12345.

4. Make your changes

5. Test your changes

6. Create a [pull request](https://github.com/Kunal2007-web/KDotfiles/pulls) (PR) to propose merging your branch into the main repository. Provide a clear and concise description of the changes you made, along with any relevant context or motivations behind them. If your PR addresses a specific issue, reference it in the title. For instance, if you are working on a new feature add the feature name in the title like "Add Logging" and then describe in the description on how and why you added this feature. If you are working on issue or feature request, add the ID in the title like "Zsh Extension Fix (#12345)", here, 12345 being the issue ID #12345.

The PR will be reviewed as soon as possible. Please be patient during the review process, and try to engage in any discussions related to your contribution.

## Code Conventions

Here are some conventions, we expect to be followed while making a code contribution:

* If a new dotfile is being added the first line on the dotfile should be comment telling the name and original author of the dotfile. For Example: "Zsh Config - Kunal Kumar".

* Commit messages should be filled with the commit template provided in the project.

* All dotfiles should have different sections for different configurations like plugins, variables, positioning, etc.

Once again, we thank you for your contribution to the project. 💖
